      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p></p>I moved to Utah three years ago with the search for adventure. I spent most of my time living outside and working at a wilderness therapy program. I have spent a lot of time exploring the mountains and the deserts of the Utah wilderness. Since I'm not a fan of the snow, I had to come inside. I started working at an all girls residential treatment center which is where I work currently. I am a proud dog mom of a rescued pup. His name is Juniper, and he has become the love of my life.  I love embacing new challenges and experiencing the ride that comes with them.
      <h1>Where I'm from</h1>
      <p>Detroit, Michigan</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love being outdoors, so some of my favorite hobbies are swimming, hiking, camping, and climbing. Another hobby of mine is art. I have created art for many years and continue to experiment with different mediums all the time.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job is one that allows me to be creative, work from home, as well as travel the world.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Salt Lake City, Utah</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I want to be a web developer so I can join the family business. My parents have run a succesful computer company for over 25 years, and I hope to attain new skills and knowledge to succeed in their business. Taking on the role of a web developer will allow me to have a stable career that also provides the freedom of working from home.</p>
